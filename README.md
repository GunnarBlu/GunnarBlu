# 👨‍🔧🖥️ Gunnar R.

**`IT Student/Professional`**

Growing up I always thought my career would involve technology in some way. Well, I wasn't wrong because here I am, in the IT industry. My passion for technology has led me to valuable experiences in infrastructure automation, cloud computing, system and network installation, configuration, deployment, and troubleshooting. I plan on gaining professional experience in this industry and advancing into a role where I can apply my knowledge, skills, and competencies.
